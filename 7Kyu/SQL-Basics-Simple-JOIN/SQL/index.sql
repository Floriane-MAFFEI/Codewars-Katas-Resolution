-- For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the products table, and join to the companies table so that you can return the company name.

-- products table schema
-- id
-- name
-- isbn
-- company_id
-- price
-- companies table schema
-- id
-- name
-- You should return all product fields as well as the company name as "company_name".

-- NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.

SELECT
    products.id,
    products.name,
    products.isbn,
    products.company_id,
    products.price,
    companies.name AS company_name
FROM
    products
JOIN
    companies
ON
    products.company_id = companies.id;
