-- Your classmates asked you to copy some paperwork for them. You know that there are 'n' classmates and the paperwork has 'm' pages.

-- Your task is to calculate how many blank pages do you need. If n < 0 or m < 0 return 0.

-- Example:
-- n= 5, m=5: 25
-- n=-5, m=5:  0

-- # write your SQL statement here: you are given a table 'paperwork' 
-- with columns 'id', n' and 'm', return a table with columns 'n', 'm' and your result in a column named 'res'.

SELECT n, m,  
  CASE 
    WHEN n >= 0 AND m >= 0 THEN n * m
    ELSE 0
  END AS res
FROM paperwork
